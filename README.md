# Sincast
This is the very first Sincast version! A R package will be release soon! Here I will give a very brife introduction to Sincast using the 

1. Query data from [Bian et al.(2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2316-7): **Deciphering human macrophage development at single-cell resolution.** 

2. Referncce data from [Rajab et al.(2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.04.010): **An integrated analysis of human myeloid cells identifies gaps in in vitro models of in vivo biology

The query data can be downloaded at NCBI [GSE133345](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133345), and the reference data can be downloaded at the [Stemformatic data protal](https://www.stemformatics.org/atlas/myeloid). They are also available at our github page.

Now download [sincast package.R](https://github.com/meiosis97/Sincast/blob/main/sincast%20package.R) to get started!

# Load functions
