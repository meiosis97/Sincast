# Sincast
This is the very first Sincast version! A R package will be release soon! Here I will give a very brife introduction to Sincast using the query data from [Bian et al.(2017)](): **Deciphering human macrophage development at single-cell resolution.** The data can be downloaded at NCBI [GSE133345](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133345), as well as our github page
