Description: Sincast is a computational framework to query scRNA-seq data based on bulk reference atlases. Prior to projection, single cell data are transformed to be directly comparable to bulk data, either with pseudo-bulk aggregation or graph-based imputation to address sparse single cell expression profiles. Sincast avoids batch effect correction, and cell identity is predicted along a continuum to highlight new cell states not found in the reference atlas.
